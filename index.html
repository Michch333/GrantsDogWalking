            This is a sample paragraph to fill this data in. We are going to be styling these paragraphs so that the font is different the more you zoom in. This is done using Media Quereies.
        </p>
        <p class="two">
            Welcome to Paragraph two. This is a second Paragraph to accomplish the same thing we described in the second paragraph. The only difference is the style broken up by each paragraph.
        </p>
        <p class="three">
            And finally paragraph three. I'm going to use this to talk about break points. Larger phone screens usually stop at about 480 pixels, where most tablets stop at 768 pixels. Laptops typically will go as large as 992 pixels, but we should be okay using 1200 for desktop sizing.
